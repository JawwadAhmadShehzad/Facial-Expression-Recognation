HTML and CSS:

The HTML file (index.html) is a web page that includes a form with an input field to upload an image, a button to predict emotions, and different divisions to display the image and predictions.
CSS is used for styling, including setting a background image with blur effect, adding animations, and styling various elements.
CSS Styling:

The body style sets the background image, applies a blur effect using backdrop-filter, and uses flexbox to center the content.
Animations (like fadeIn, bounce, slideInLeft) are defined using @keyframes to create visual effects when elements appear on the screen.
Styles for various elements like h1, form, label, #image-preview, img, #prediction, and button are defined to enhance the overall look.
JavaScript:

Two JavaScript functions are defined:
previewImage(): This function is triggered when an image is selected. It reads the selected image and displays a preview.
predictEmotion(): This function is triggered when the "Predict Emotion" button is clicked. It sends the selected image to the server for prediction using a POST request.
Flask (Python):

The Flask web application serves the HTML file and handles the prediction logic.
It loads a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for emotion recognition.
The index() function renders the HTML page.
The /predict route receives a POST request with an image, preprocesses the image, and uses the trained model to predict the emotion.
The predicted emotion is sent back to the client as a JSON response.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model:

The CNN model is defined using the Keras library. It consists of convolutional layers, batch normalization, max pooling, flattening, and dense layers.
The model is trained on the FER2013 dataset, which contains facial expressions.
Training and Saving Model:

The model is trained and saved using the my_model() function and the training data.
If a pre-trained model exists, it is loaded; otherwise, a new model is trained and saved.
Emotion Analysis:

The emotions_list contains emotion labels ('Angry', 'Disgust', 'Fear', 'Happy', 'Sad', 'Surprise', 'Neutral').
The preprocess_image() function prepares the input image for the model.
The emotion_analysis() function converts the model's output to a dictionary with emotion labels and corresponding probabilities.
Running the Application:

The if __name__ == '__main__': block runs the Flask application in debug mode.
Client-Side Interaction:

The client uploads an image, previews it, and clicks the "Predict Emotion" button.
The JavaScript function sends the image to the server (/predict route) for prediction.
The server responds with the predicted emotion, which is displayed on the web page.
